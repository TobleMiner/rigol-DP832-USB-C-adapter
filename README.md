Rigol DP832 USB-C adapter
=========================

This PCB is a dual USB-C port adapter for the Rigol DP832.  
Slotting right onto channel three of the DP832 it provides you with dual
USB-C ports for powering your homemade USB gadgets.

**Note this design is still untested. PCBs are on their way from China but will take
some more weeks**

# Limitations

This board is 5V only. No PD negotiation supported.

# Ordering

The fabrication files inside `fab` are JLCPCB-ready. Leave settings at default but select
ENIG surface finish and specify order number location for best results. Also remember to
choose your favourite PCB color ;)  

The zip archive does also contain all files required for JLC assembly. So you can also order
fully assembled boards from JLC.
